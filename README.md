# Chatbot
This software will perform tasks such as responding quickly to users, informing them, assisting with product purchases, and providing better customer service. Chatbot programs work on Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and Machine Learning Forums. A chatbot is more common in business groups as it can reduce customer service costs and host more users.
